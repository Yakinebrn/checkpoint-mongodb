MongoDB CRUD Operations Checkpoint
📌 Objective

The goal of this checkpoint is to practice CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) in MongoDB by managing a simple contacts list.

🗄️ Database & Collection

A database named "contact" is created.

A collection named "contactlist" is created to store all contacts.

📝 Inserted Documents

The following contacts are added to the collection:

Last Name: Ben, First Name: Moris, Email: ben@gmail.com
, Age: 26

Last Name: Kefi, First Name: Seif, Email: kefi@gmail.com
, Age: 15

Last Name: Emilie, First Name: brouge, Email: emilie.b@gmail.com
, Age: 40

Last Name: Alex, First Name: brown, Age: 4

Last Name: Denzel, First Name: Washington, Age: 3

🔎 Tasks Performed

Display all contacts – a complete list of all contacts in the collection is viewed.

Display a single contact by ID – all information about a specific person is retrieved using their unique identifier.

Filter contacts by age – only contacts aged over 18 are displayed.

Filter contacts by age and name – contacts aged over 18 whose first or last names contain the letters "ah" are displayed.

Update a contact – the first name of the contact "Kefi Seif" is changed to "Kefi Anis".

Delete contacts – all contacts aged under 5 are removed from the collection.

Display the final list – the updated collection is displayed after all modifications.

📷 Deliverables

Each operation is executed in the MongoDB shell.

Screenshots of the results are saved as proof of completion.

✅ This checkpoint demonstrates practical usage of MongoDB CRUD operations, including insertion, retrieval, updating, deletion, and filtering of data.
